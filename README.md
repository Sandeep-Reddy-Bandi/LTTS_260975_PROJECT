### Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. First of all I am not aware of how to use linux environment as git is also linux so I had faced several issues a lot but later on due to connect sessions of LTTS and online resourses I am able to work with linux environment.
2. As Test the code is very crucial and I don't have any knowledge in testing but I Successfully passed the testcases by peer helps.
3. Implementation using Multi File & Multifile Programming. With alot of experiementation in various ways successfully done.
4. Training sessions helped me lot in completing this professional project Thanks LTTS you guys helped me a lot.
