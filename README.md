Lift Management System written in C programming language.
  
Description:
	Lift Management System: In this project I am going to Design a program that simulates two lefts. The lifts serves floors from zero (the basement) to the top floor. It is an old lift and itâ€™s not automatic. When people get in the lift, they enter their desired floor number. Several numbers can be requested at a time. After all numbers have been entered, the door is closed by pressing the close door number (the return key). Each time the door closes, the lift checks to see if there are any floors in the current direction (up or down). If there are, then it services these floors first, starting with the closest one to the current floor. If there are no floors requiring stops in the current directions, it checks the opposite direction, again servicing the floor closest to the current floor. If the lift is not moving (direction STOP), then it services up requests before down requests. Each time, the elevator arrives at a floor, new passengers can get on and request a floor. The new requests are added to the ones still pending, and the lifts again evaluates which floor and which lift will be processed first.
